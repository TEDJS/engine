# TED
The transpiler to rule them all.
TED is a Chrome Extension for easier transpilation of code, making it fast to prototype anywhere and easily integrate with the tools you already use (vim, git, ...).

# Chrome Extension Installation
1. Download the lastest release (TED.crx file) and drop it into the "Manage Extensions" page on your Chrome.
2. Run your files using a web server. If you don't have one and don't have the possibility of setting up a local one, please install [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog)
